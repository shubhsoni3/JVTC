    title: "What are TESA and PESA, and how do they differ ?",
    content:
      "TESA (Testicular Sperm Aspiration) and PESA (Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm Aspiration) are procedures used to retrieve sperm directly from the male reproductive organs in cases where sperm are not present in the ejaculate (azoospermia). TESA involves using a needle to extract sperm directly from the testicular tissue, while PESA involves using a needle to extract sperm from the epididymis, a duct behind the testis where sperm mature and are stored.",
  },
  {
    title: "Who can benefit from TESA/PESA procedures ?",
    content:
      "TESA and PESA are beneficial for men with obstructive azoospermia, which involves blockages in the reproductive tract preventing sperm from being ejaculated, often due to vasectomy, congenital absence of the vas deferens, or infections; non-obstructive azoospermia, which involves sperm production issues within the testes; failed vasectomy reversals, when surgical attempts to reverse vasectomy are unsuccessful; and other conditions where sperm retrieval from the testes or epididymis is necessary for assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF or ICSI.",
  },
  {
    title: "How are TESA and PESA procedures performed ?",
    content:
      "Both procedures are minimally invasive and typically performed under local anesthesia. TESA involves inserting a fine needle into the testicle to aspirate small amounts of tissue, which is then processed in the lab to extract viable sperm. PESA involves inserting a fine needle into the epididymis to aspirate fluid containing sperm, which is then processed to extract viable sperm. Both procedures are usually done on an outpatient basis and take about 20-30 minutes.",
  },
  {
    title: "What are the success rates and outcomes of TESA/PESA ?",
    content:
      "The success rates of TESA and PESA in retrieving viable sperm can vary based on the underlying cause of azoospermia. For obstructive azoospermia, success rates are often above 90% as sperm production is typically normal. For non-obstructive azoospermia, success rates generally range between 30-70% depending on the extent of sperm production issues. Retrieved sperm can be used immediately for IVF/ICSI or cryopreserved for future use. Success rates of resulting IVF/ICSI cycles depend on several factors, including the quality of the retrieved sperm and the female partnerâ€™s age and health.",
  },
  {
    title: "Are there any risks or side effects associated with TESA/PESA ?",
    content:
      "TESA and PESA are generally safe procedures with minimal risks, but potential side effects and risks include discomfort or pain at the site of needle insertion, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication; minor swelling or bruising of the scrotum, usually resolving within a few days; a rare risk of infection at the needle insertion site, which can be mitigated with proper aseptic techniques; minimal risk of bleeding within the scrotum, generally self-limiting and not requiring intervention; and the emotional and psychological aspects of undergoing these procedures and potential outcomes, which should be considered and supported with counseling if needed.",

                  <p>
                    TESA (Testicular Sperm Aspiration) and PESA (Percutaneous
                    Epididymal Sperm Aspiration) are specialized procedures
                    designed to retrieve sperm directly from the testicles or
                    epididymis of men who have fertility issues. At Jabalpur
                    Fertility Centre, known as the Best Fertility Clinic in
                    Jabalpur, we offer advanced male infertility treatments

                  <h1>What is TESA/PESA ?</h1>
                  <p>
                    TESA and PESA are minimally invasive procedures used to
                    collect sperm when there is a blockage or absence of sperm
                    in the ejaculate. These techniques enable men with certain
                    types of infertility to still father biological children
                    through assisted reproductive technologies like IVF and
                    ICSI.
                  </p>

                  <p>
